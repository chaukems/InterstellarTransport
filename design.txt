Design Considerations
------------------------
I have followed below OOP and SOLID design principles:
1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
2. Encapsulate What Changes
3. Open Closed Design Principle - Classes, methods, or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification
4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
6. Delegation principles
7. Design patterns

And I have considered the following
1.	Reusability
2.	Robustness
3.	Performance
4.	Readability
5.	Separation of concerns

I have opted to include swagger documentation to document and give usage of the service.
